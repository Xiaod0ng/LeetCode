# Problem 180

## Description

Table: `Logs`

<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
</pre>

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.  
Return the result table in **any order**.  
The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
<b>Output:</b>
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
<b>Explanation:</b> 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
</pre>

## Solutions

**Solution 1:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT L1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs L1, Logs L2, Logs L3
WHERE L1.id = L2.id + 1
AND L2.id = L3.id + 1
AND L1.num = L2.num
AND L2.num = L3.num
```

To find number that appears consecutively for at least three times, we need to make sure `id`, `id + 1` and `id + 2` have the same `num`. But this is not a good solution because we cannot use something like `id + 99` if the problem asks for consecutive number that appears for 100 times.

After some trials and failures, I found the following solution which can apply to `N` consecutive numbers.

**Solution 2:**

```sql
DECLARE @N INT = 3 -- N consecutive number
SELECT DISTINCT L1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs L1
JOIN(
	SELECT
		MAX(i.id) max,
		MIN(i.id) min,
		num,
		identifier
	FROM
	(
		SELECT
			id,
			num,
			(id-DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY num ORDER BY id)) AS identifier
		FROM Logs) AS i
		GROUP BY num, identifier
	) AS L2
ON L1.num = L2.num
WHERE max - min >= (@N - 1)
```

Let me explain in detail in case I would forget one day...

**Step 1:**  
Use `DENSE_RANK()` to rank within the same num.

```sql
SELECT
	id,
	num,
	(id - DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY num ORDER BY id)) AS identifier
FROM Logs
```

The result would be like this:

<pre>
+----+-----+------------+
| id | num | identifier |
+----+-----+------------+
| 1  |  1  |     0      |
| 2  |  1  |     0      |
| 3  |  1  |     0      |
| 5  |  1  |     1      |
| 4  |  2  |     3      |
| 6  |  2  |     4      |
| 7  |  2  |     4      |
+----+-----+------------+
</pre>

For why not using `ROW_NUMBER()` or `RANK()`, please refer to [Problem 178](https://github.com/Xiaod0ng/LeetCode/blob/main/Database/178.%20Rank%20Scores.md).

**Step 2:**  
Seems we can find some patterns here, but not enough. We need to group the data by `num` and `identifier`.  
With following query,

```sql
SELECT MAX(i.id) max,
	   MIN(i.id) min,
	   num,
	   identifier
FROM
(
	SELECT
		id,
		num,
		(id - DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY num ORDER BY id)) AS identifier
	FROM Logs
) AS i
GROUP BY num, identifier
```

we can get

<pre>
+-----+-----+-----+------------+
| max | min | num | identifier |
+-----+-----+-----+------------+
|  3  |  1  |  1  |     0      |
|  5  |  5  |  1  |     1      |
|  4  |  4  |  2  |     3      |
|  7  |  6  |  2  |     4      |
+-----+-----+-----+------------+
</pre>

So the logic here is: if there is a consecutive number appears 3 or more times, in the same num group, their `identifier` should be the same. (Remember `identifier` equals `id - DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY num ORDER BY id)`). Thus, in the same `identifier` group, if there are 3 or more rows, the corresponding `num` is the number we want.

**Step 3:**  
In this case, we just need to select the distinct `num` with condition `max(id)` in the group minus `min(id)` in the group equals or is larger than 2.  
So we have the solution query. I declared an int `@N` here to make it configurable. You can change the number directly in `WHERE` clause as well.
