# Problem 595

## Description

Table: `Courses`

<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| student     | varchar |
| class       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(student, class) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.
</pre>

Write an SQL query to report all the classes that have **at least five students**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
Courses table:
+---------+----------+
| student | class    |
+---------+----------+
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |
+---------+----------+
<b>Output: </b>
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
<b>Explanation: </b>
- Math has 6 students, so we include it.
- English has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.
</pre>

## Solution

```sql
SELECT class
FROM (SELECT COUNT(student) AS number, class FROM Courses GROUP BY class) AS new
WHERE new.number >= 5
```
