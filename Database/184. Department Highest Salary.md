</pre>

Write an SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
<b>Output:</b> 
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
<b>Explanation:</b> Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.
</pre>

## Solution

**Solution 1:**

```sql
SELECT
    Department, Employee, Salary
FROM (
    SELECT e.id AS EmployeeId, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary, d.name AS Department, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY d.name ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS DenseRank
    FROM Employee e
    JOIN Department d
    ON e.departmentId = d.id) AS New
WHERE DenseRank = 1
```

**Solution 2:**

Use `GROUP BY`. This query is much faster than the previous one.

```sql
SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d
ON e.departmentId = d.id
RIGHT JOIN (SELECT MAX(salary) AS MaxSalary, departmentId FROM Employee GROUP BY departmentId) AS new
ON e.departmentId = new.departmentId AND e.salary = new.MaxSalary
```
