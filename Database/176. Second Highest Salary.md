#### Problem 176

Table: `Employee`

<pre>
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
</pre> 

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report `null`.

The query result format is in the following example. 

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
<b>Output:</b>
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
<b>Output:</b> 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
</pre>

#### Solution

```sql
SELECT ISNULL(
    (SELECT DISTINCT New.salary
    FROM (SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS DenseRank FROM Employee) AS New 
    WHERE New.DenseRank = 2), NULL) 
AS SecondHighestSalary
```

This problem took me quite some time because I'm not familiar with `ISNULL()`. So I wanted to use `CASE` to return `NULL`, but I cannot use `COUNT()` or `MAX()` in `WHEN` clause. Adding the query that won't work in case anyone runs into it.

```sql
SELECT 
	CASE
		WHEN MAX(New.DenseRank) <= 2 THEN NULL
		ELSE (SELECT New.salary WHERE New.DenseRank = 2)
	END
	AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM (SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary) AS DenseRank FROM Employee) AS New
```
