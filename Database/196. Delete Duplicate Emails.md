#### Problem 196

Table: `Person`

<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
</pre>

Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`. Note that you are supposed to write a `DELETE` statement and not a `SELECT` one.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
<b>Output:</b> 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
<b>Explanation:</b> john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
</pre>

#### Solution

```sql
DELETE a FROM Person a, Person b 
WHERE a.email = b.email AND a.id > b.id
```
