A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A **high earner** in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who are **high earners** in each of the departments.

Return the result table **in any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
<b>Output:</b> 
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
<b>Explanation:</b> 
In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees

## Solution

If you have reviewed [Problem 184](/Database/184.%20Department%20Highest%20Salary.md), it should be quite easy to solve this problem.

```sql
SELECT
    Department, Employee, Salary
FROM (
    SELECT e.id AS EmployeeId, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary, d.name AS Department, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY d.name ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS DenseRank
    FROM Employee e
    JOIN Department d
    ON e.departmentId = d.id) AS New
WHERE DenseRank IN (1, 2, 3)
```

The only difference is to change `DenseRank` from `= 1` to `IN (1, 2, 3)`.

Why not using `GROUP BY` in this problem? `GROUP BY` is often used with aggregate function (`COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`). It cannot return multiple values in a single group.
