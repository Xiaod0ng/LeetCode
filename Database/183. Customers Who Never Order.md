# Problem 183

## Description

Table: `Customers`

<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
</pre>

Table: `Orders`

<pre>
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
</pre>

Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
<b>Output:</b> 
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
</pre>

## Solution

```sql
SELECT name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.id NOT IN (SELECT customerId FROM Orders)
```
