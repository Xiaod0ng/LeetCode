# Problem 178

## Description

Table `Scores`

<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| score       | decimal |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the score of a game. Score is a floating point value with two decimal places.
</pre>

Write an SQL query to rank the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:

- The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
- If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
- After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.

Return the result table ordered by `score` in descending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
Scores table:
+----+-------+
| id | score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
<b>Output:</b>
+-------+------+
| score | rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
</pre>

## Solution

```sql
SELECT score, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank
FROM Scores
```

We cannot use `ROW_NUMBER()` or `RANK()` here. Here is the comparison between these three functions.

<pre>
+-------+------------+------+------------+
| score | Dense_Rank | Rank | Row_Number |
+-------+------------+------+------------+
| 4.00  |     1      |  1   |     1      |
| 4.00	|     1      |	1   |     2      |
| 3.85	|     2      |	3   |     3      |
| 3.65	|     3	     |	4   |	  4      |
| 3.65	|     3	     |	4   |	  5      |
| 3.50	|     4      |  6   |	  6      |
+-------+------------+------+------------+
</pre>
