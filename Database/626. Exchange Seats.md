#### Problem 626

Table: `Seat`
<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
id is a continuous increment.
</pre> 

Write an SQL query to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by `id` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
<b>Output:</b> 
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
<b>Explanation:</b> 
Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.
</pre>

#### Solution 1

```sql
SELECT  s1.id, s2.student
	    FROM Seat s1, Seat s2
	    WHERE (s1.id = s2.id + 1 AND s1.id % 2 = 0)
	    OR (s1.id = s2.id - 1 AND s1.id % 2 <> 0 AND s1.id <> (SELECT TOP 1 (id) FROM Seat ORDER BY id DESC))
	    OR (s1.id = s2.id AND s1.id % 2 <> 0 AND s1.id = (SELECT TOP 1 (id) FROM Seat ORDER BY id DESC))
```

#### Solution 2

```sql
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN id % 2 <> 0 AND id = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Seat) THEN id -- last one is odd
		WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1 -- even
		ELSE id + 1 -- odd
	END
	AS id,
	student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id
```
