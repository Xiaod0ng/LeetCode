Table: `Department`
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| revenue     | int     |
| month       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].
 ```

Write an SQL query to reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column **for each month**.  
Return the result table in **any order**.  
The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
Department table:
+------+---------+-------+
| id   | revenue | month |
+------+---------+-------+
| 1    | 8000    | Jan   |
| 2    | 9000    | Jan   |
| 3    | 10000   | Feb   |
| 1    | 7000    | Feb   |
| 1    | 6000    | Mar   |
+------+---------+-------+
<b>Output:</b> 
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| id   | Jan_Revenue | Feb_Revenue | Mar_Revenue | ... | Dec_Revenue |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| 1    | 8000        | 7000        | 6000        | ... | null        |
| 2    | 9000        | null        | null        | ... | null        |
| 3    | null        | 10000       | null        | ... | null        |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
<b>Explanation</b>: The revenue from Apr to Dec is null.
Note that the result table has 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).
</pre>

**Solution 1:**
```sql
select distinct d.id, 
	Jan.revenue as Jan_Revenue, 
	Feb.revenue as Feb_Revenue, 
	Mar.revenue as Mar_Revenue, 
	Apr.revenue as Apr_Revenue, 
	May.revenue as May_Revenue, 
	Jun.revenue as Jun_Revenue, 
	Jul.revenue as Jul_Revenue, 
	Aug.revenue as Aug_Revenue, 
	Sep.revenue as Sep_Revenue, 
	Oct.revenue as Oct_Revenue, 
	Nov.revenue as Nov_Revenue, 
	Dec.revenue as Dec_Revenue
from Department d
left join (select * from Department where month = 'Jan') as Jan on d.id = Jan.id
left join (select * from Department where month = 'Feb') as Feb on d.id = Feb.id
left join (select * from Department where month = 'Mar') as Mar on d.id = Mar.id
left join (select * from Department where month = 'Apr') as Apr on d.id = Apr.id
left join (select * from Department where month = 'May') as May on d.id = May.id
left join (select * from Department where month = 'Jun') as Jun on d.id = Jun.id
left join (select * from Department where month = 'Jul') as Jul on d.id = Jul.id
left join (select * from Department where month = 'Aug') as Aug on d.id = Aug.id
left join (select * from Department where month = 'Sep') as Sep on d.id = Sep.id
left join (select * from Department where month = 'Oct') as Oct on d.id = Oct.id
left join (select * from Department where month = 'Nov') as Nov on d.id = Nov.id
left join (select * from Department where month = 'Dec') as Dec on d.id = Dec.id
```  


**Solution 2:**
  
Use [PIVOT table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-using-pivot-and-unpivot?view=sql-server-ver15)
```sql
select id,
    [Jan] as Jan_Revenue,
    [Feb] as Feb_Revenue,
    [Mar] as Mar_Revenue,
    [Apr] as Apr_Revenue,
    [May] as May_Revenue,
    [Jun] as Jun_Revenue,
    [Jul] as Jul_Revenue,
    [Aug] as Aug_Revenue,
    [Sep] as Sep_Revenue,
    [Oct] as Oct_Revenue,
    [Nov] as Nov_Revenue,
    [Dec] as Dec_Revenue
from Department
pivot
(   
	max(revenue)
	for month in ([Jan], [Feb], [Mar], [Apr], [May], [Jun], [Jul], [Aug], [Sep], [Oct], [Nov], [Dec])
) as MonthRevenue
```

In PIVOT operator, it is required to use aggregation function. In this case, it is `max(revenue)`. For columns that you don't need to change the value, you can use `max()` because `max()` of one value is actually the value itself. Please refer to this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1343145/tsql-pivot-without-aggregate-function) on stackoverflow.
