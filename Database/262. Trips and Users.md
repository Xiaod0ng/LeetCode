#### Problem 262

Table: `Trips`
<pre>
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| client_id   | int      |
| driver_id   | int      |
| city_id     | int      |
| status      | enum     |
| request_at  | date     |     
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique id, while client_id and driver_id are foreign keys to the users_id at the Users table.
Status is an ENUM type of ('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client').
</pre> 

Table: `Users`
<pre>
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| users_id    | int      |
| banned      | enum     |
| role        | enum     |
+-------------+----------+
users_id is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all users. Each user has a unique users_id, and role is an ENUM type of ('client', 'driver', 'partner').
banned is an ENUM type of ('Yes', 'No').
</pre> 

The **cancellation rate** is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Write a SQL query to find the **cancellation rate** of requests with unbanned users (**both client and driver must not be banned**) each day between `"2013-10-01"` and `"2013-10-03"`. Round `Cancellation Rate` to **two decimal** points.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

+------------+-------------------+
<b>Explanation:</b> 
On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50
</pre>

#### Solution 1

```sql
SELECT b.request_at AS Day, 
	CASE 
		WHEN Cancelled IS NULL THEN 0
		ELSE CAST(CAST(Cancelled AS DECIMAL(3,2))/CAST(Total AS DECIMAL(3,2)) AS DECIMAL(3,2))
	END
	AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM
(
    SELECT request_at, COUNT(*) AS Cancelled
    FROM
    (
	    SELECT * FROM Trips 
	    WHERE client_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = 'No') 
	    AND driver_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = 'No')
	    AND status <> 'Completed'
    ) AS CancelledData
    GROUP BY request_at
) AS a
FULL JOIN
(
    SELECT request_at, COUNT(*) AS Total
    FROM
    (
	    SELECT * FROM Trips 
	    WHERE client_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = 'No') 
	    AND driver_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = 'No')
    ) AS AllData
GROUP BY request_at
) AS b
ON a.request_at = b.request_at
WHERE b.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
```
My logic is to find cancelled requests and total requests group by `request_at`, then use cancelled number to be devided by total number.   

So to find cancelled requests, we need to match users who are not banned and status is not completed. In my query, the table is renamed as `CancelledData`. Similarly, we also need to find all requests on the same day. The query is quite similar to the cancelled one. The only difference is we don't need to add a condition on `status`. This table is renamed as `AllData` in the above query. Then we need to `FULL JOIN` both tables on the same date. By now, we get all the data we need. 

Next step is to select the column and add some proper conditions. The `Day` column is quite straightforward. To return `Cancellation Rate`, we need to consider two cases. One is no cancelled requests, the other one has cancelled requests. If no cancelled requests, `Cancelled` will return `NULL`. So if it returns  `NULL`, the `Cancellation Rate` is `0`. In the other case, `Cancellation Rate` equals to `Cancelled/Total`. Remember to round it to two decimal points. Lastly, don't forget to add date range. The problem asks us to return the date between `2013-10-01` and `2013-10-03`.

#### Solution 2

```sql
SELECT  request_at AS Day, 
	    CAST(CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN status <> 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS DECIMAL(3,2))/CAST(COUNT(*) AS DECIMAL(3,2)) AS DECIMAL(3,2)) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM Trips
WHERE client_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = 'No') 
AND driver_id IN (SELECT users_id FROM Users WHERE banned = 'No')
AND (request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03')
GROUP BY request_at
```
This solution is neat and much easier to understand, isn't it? :satisfied: First of all, we filter `users_id` and `request_at` to return all the data meeting the requirements. To return the data by `request_at`, we can use `GROUP BY request_at`. The tricky part is how to get the value with different `status` conditions? Thus we introduce `CASE` statement. When `status <> 'Completed'`, it is one record. By adding them together with `SUM()`, we have cancelled requests. For all requests on each day, we can simply use `COUNT()`.
